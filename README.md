# NoteTaker
The automatic NoteTaker written in C++ in a Win32 application. 


This project is still under development. This is supposed to be the upgraded version of the Python automatic NoteTaker. 

TODO: 
  1. Find a suitable Speech Recognition library for Native C++. I am currently testing both Julius and Wav2Letter (now known as Flashlight). 
  2. Find a way to embed Python without getting compilation errors :weary. Either that or find a native C++ library for grabbing YouTube videos
  3. Find a suitable summarization library for abstractive summarization. 
  4. Integrate a Desktop GUI framework to make the application look nicer. 
  
How to contribute: 
1. Download the source code by cloning the repository. 
2. Open the .sln file and begin development. 
3. For any feedback, feel free to post in the issues or create a pull request.
